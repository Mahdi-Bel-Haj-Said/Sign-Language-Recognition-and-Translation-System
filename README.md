#  Sign Language Recognition and Translation System
## Overview 
This project is an AI-powered sign language recognition and translation system built using Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Scikit-learn, and MediaPipe.
The system detects hand gestures in real time and translates them into text, providing an inclusive communication tool for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.

The application can be integrated into communication and meeting platforms (e.g., Zoom, Teams, Google Meet) to enhance accessibility and make digital conversations more inclusive.
