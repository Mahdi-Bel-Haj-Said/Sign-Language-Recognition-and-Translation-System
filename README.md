# Sign-Language-Recognition-and-Translation-System
This project is an AI-powered sign language recognition and translation system built using Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Scikit-learn, and MediaPipe. The system detects hand gestures in real time and translates them into text, providing an inclusive communication tool for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.

The application can be integrated into communication and meeting platforms (e.g., Zoom, Teams, Google Meet) to enhance accessibility and make digital conversations more inclusive.
